# 🍬 Crush Force 3.0  
*A Candy Crush–style Match-3 Game built in C++ using SFML 2.6.1*

Crush Force 3.0 is a graphical Match-3 puzzle game developed as part of a **Programming Fundamentals (C++)** course project in semester 01 of BS Software Engineering.  
The game is inspired by Candy Crush and implements core game mechanics such as matching, gravity, refilling, boosters, scoring, levels, and lives — all built from scratch using **C++ and SFML**.
